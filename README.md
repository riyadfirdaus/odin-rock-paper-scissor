## Summary
### What I've Learned
#### Better Knowledge at DOM Manipulation
  It's my first project that involves DOM manipulation. It's a little bit hard at first because I'm not familiar with the syntax and how DOM manipulation with javascript works. After I getting used to it, I can easily combine it with conditional statement to change some element such as: change the emoji in scoreboard based on what user choose, change the scoreboard color based on the result (win, lose, or draw has a different color), etc.


#### Learned how to write and apply clean code
I applied some concept such as:
1. Using meaningful names for variables, functions, and method.
2. Using semantic HTML
3. Consistent Javascript Styling

My Code now has better readability and I can review my code faster than before. For example, if there was a logic error, I could find the bugs easily when my code is clean.
